  ## Description
  Shop Shop is an E-commerce web application template. The application was built using React, Node, Express, MongoDB for the NoSQL databse, and GraphQL for data queries. The application uses Stripe for payment, and is set up as a Stripe test checkout. This application also uses IndexedDB for data persistence and continued functionality if users experience poor or loss of internet connectivity.
